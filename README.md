# Betray The Party
jquery javascript game

Welcome to Betray the Party!

I made this game because of my love of RPG games and tabletop games such as D&D.
It helps simulate what its like to betray your friends and destroy the campaign.
An ode to my friends who will never forget the name Curio. (There are no Bards here)

How to play:

1. Click one of the character portraits to select your character.

2. Click one of the character portaits to select your opponent.

3. Click the attack button to fight your enemy.

4. Repeat step 2 and 3. You will either win or lose depending on the order you decide to fight the party.

5. You can click the reset button to play again!
